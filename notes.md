# Realities of Developing Where we Are At

- we understand basic syntax
- we want to try for TDD
- but we are still learning the ropes of testing

Instead, focus on feature driven development

- for this segment of the program, what needs to be done?
- And the next?
- Each component is a sub-feature of the final output we expect

At this point in the program, we mistake the forest for the tress

- we focus too niche on something
- or try to do too much all at once (often this)

We need to find the middle path, and focus on the minimum that we can do to deftly build a large application

# Considerations

- try to move methods/functions to classes
- try to keep code pure - functions/methods are focused on inputs (args) and outputs (return values)
